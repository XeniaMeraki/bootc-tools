# Bootc image templates and documentation


Blue Build custom image bootc template (sh files focus) - https://github.com/blue-build/template


Universal Blue custom image bootc template (container file focus) - https://github.com/ublue-os/image-template


https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/Introduction.html - Podman documentation, helps a lot with understanding containerfile use.


https://bootc-dev.github.io/ - Bootc documentation for developers


https://docs.bazzite.gg/ - For regular user use of the Bazzite OS, lots of tips for regular usage of any bootc system/the downfalls.


https://github.com/bootc-dev/bootc - Bootc Github


https://github.com/bootcrew/arch-bootc - A template image for Arch Bootc systems to work from. (I am elevating this above other templates from personal bias)


https://github.com/XeniaMeraki/XeniaOS - Speaking of personal bias, this is my own bootc project. Based on Arch Bootc, making use of AURs, forging the way forward for non-Fedora Bootc based images. (Fedora Bootc until very recently was the Only base you could use.)


https://bb-directory.github.io/ - Directory of custom blue build (and others) bootc images, usually being "distros" with a much smaller amount of users than Bazzite/Aurora/Bluefin/Fedora Silverblue as the most well-known variants of bootc.


https://universal-blue.discourse.group/t/list-of-community-created-custom-images/340 - A short list of close-to-Bazzite custom images.


I have ongoing requests for Chaotic-AUR to host a couple packages for quicker Arch Bootc compile times: [https://github.com/chaotic-aur/packages/issues/3966](bootc) [https://github.com/chaotic-aur/packages/issues/3974](flatpak-git) Reactions to these posts to show support is appreciated.
